# gulpwpstarter

some gulp things to make some tasks easier working with wordpress and gulp
Two branches are availble, one that uses [underscores](http://underscores.me/) wordpress template, ane that is called **gulp-only** which only features the gulp package

If you don't know what gulp is go [here](https://gulpjs.com/) to get started.

Gulp commands:

````shell
 npm install ```
After `npm install`
just run `gulp`
to get started

If you want to build and compress stuff into a neat folder run:
`gulp build`
````
