# gulpwpstarter

Some gulp things to make some tasks easier working with wordpress and gulp.

Two branches are availble, one that uses [underscores](http://underscores.me/) wordpress template, and one that is called **gulp-only** which features only the gulp package.

If you don't know what gulp is go [here](https://gulpjs.com/) to get started.

Gulp commands:

After `$ npm install`

just run `$ gulp`
to get started

If you want to build and compress stuff into a neat folder run:

`$ gulp build`
